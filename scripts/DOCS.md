# Data Notes

## Education

'Get Information about Schools' provides data for England and Wales. Despite this, Welsh schooling data is not easily split into Primary and Secondary education. We therefore use this data for just English schools, and take Welsh schooling data from 'All Schools Wales'. Scottish data is taken from 'Scottish School Roll and Locations'.

## Bluespace

Bluespace is taken from OSM, 'nwr/natural=water', 'w/waterway=*', and 'w/natural=coastline'. All coastlines are kept, but any other non-polygon geometry is removed. Any polygon below 10,000m2 is removed.
